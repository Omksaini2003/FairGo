# FairGo-Fair-Representation-Learning-for-Recommendations

– Built a Graph-based fair recommendation model to obscure sensitive attributes in user and item embeddings, replicating the approach based on [Learning Fair Representations for Recommendation: A Graph-based Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09140).

– Implemented Adversarial training techniques and utilized real-world datasets (MovieLens, Last.fm) to evaluate
model performance, employing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and optimization via Adam for enhancing fairness without compromising recommendation accuracy.
